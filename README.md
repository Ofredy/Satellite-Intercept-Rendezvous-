# Satellite-Intercept-Rendezvous-

Project source: Fundamentals of Astrodynamics by Donald D. Mueller, Jerry White, and Roger R. Bate

Write a computer program that takes as its input radar tracking data on a target satellite, location of the tracking site, time of radar observation, and the location of an interceptor launch site. The output is to be the impulsive velocity change required for both intercept and intercept plus-rendezvous for various combinations of launch time andinterceptor time-of-flight. Neglect the atmosphere and assume impulsive velocity change from the launch site and at the target

Image below shows the software architecture of the script.
